Candybox2 Sync - Sync progress between multiple browsers. 

Installation
Need to add this to the google chrome extension store, but until then:
	1. open up chrome://extensions
	2. enable "developer mode" checkbox (top right corner)
	3. drag and drop bin/candybox2-sync.crx into extensions window
	
Usage
On a non save page (candybox2.net - no slot), you can just play and your progress will automatically be saved/loaded between browsers.

On a save page (/?slot=1 through /?slot=4) automatic saving/loading is turned off. You can enable it by clicking the lollipop icon in the address bar and clicking on "Enable". 

At any point, you can force a save with the "Force Save" option in the lollipop menu.

You can also delete your progress by hitting the "Delete" button.
